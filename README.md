## Project Overview

**CallCrunch** was created to address the challenges of digesting large amounts of information from earnings calls, particularly for tech companies. With the vast number of calls hosted on platforms like SeekingAlpha, it becomes difficult to extract actionable insights quickly. CallCrunch simplifies this process by allowing users to upload, select, and analyze earnings call transcripts using an intuitive frontend and an LLM-powered backend to answer specific questions.

This project integrates data processing and analysis with an interactive frontend to assist users in making more informed decisions in a fraction of the time.

## Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the **CallCrunch** project structure:

- **frontend**: Contains the Streamlit application for user interaction.
    - **pages**: Individual pages of the frontend such as call analysis and transcripts.
- **backend**: Handles the logic and LLM interactions for analyzing the earnings call data.
    - **data**: Stores uploaded earnings call transcripts and questions.
        - **earning-calls**: Directory to store uploaded earnings call CSVs.
        - **questions.csv**: Stores the list of questions asked by the user.
        - **responses.csv**: Stores the responses given by the system to the asked questions.

## Installation
